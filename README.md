*NoGuardian is still currently still a work in progress. Most tools will not work yet.*

**NoGuardian** is a tool that attempts to remove extensions made by GoGuardian. Technically, GoGuardian breaks the fourth amendment of the United States, as well as being mainly classified as spyware. The extension is still usable by teachers, **even if you are at your own home!**. This extension attempts to remove it, as well as if it is unable to, it also provides a web proxy.
