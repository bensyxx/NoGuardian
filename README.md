### Before saying that this dosen't work,
You're right. I haven't picked up the pace on this new version, but you can try with the old NoGuardian extension here: [https://github.com/bensyxx/Legacy-NoGuardian/README.md](https://github.com/bensyxx/Legacy-NoGuardian#readme)

## NoGuardian
NoGuardian is a tool that attempts to block or remove GoGuardian. It works on most chrome browsers and is pretty simple to install if you're used to Google Chrome Basics.

## Usability

NoGuardian Blocker is only compatiable with the GoGuardian extension. However, you can use other NoGuardian tools with any management extension.

## Credits & More mumbo jumbo

This tool is developed by [Bensyxx](https://github.com/bensyxx).
